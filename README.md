### What I learned

It was a great experience for me. Now, i have a deeper understanding of the flexbox and the way to 
split  a interface accurately to create each part one by one. 


That's true, that css was the most difficult but i understood that in a certain way, it all depends of my html.

### Continued development

now, i think i am going to focus on my way of splitting more accurately my design to 
stylize every each part in a more interesting and precise way. To be able make it quicker and prettier.
